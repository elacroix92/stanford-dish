This repository (repo) contains the code and data to reproduce all
results and figures in the 2022 Geoderma publication: **Contributions of
anoxic microsites to soil carbon protection across soil textures**.

`StanfordDish_AllData.xlsx` contains all of the data from this study.

The R Markdown files are configured to read directly from the
spreadsheet on the userâ€™s desktop.

Each RMarkdown file regenerates all results and figures used in the
manuscript. The `.md` files in this repo show formatted code output. The
`.Rmd` files can be downloaded to run and edit on your local machine.

-   `FluxData.md` shows data processing for incubation data (fluxes)
-   `ddPCR.md` shows data processing for microbial data.
-   `FeMn.md` shows data processing for acid extractable Fe and Mn
-   `GeneralSoilProperties.md` shows data processing for texture,
    aggregate size, total C, and total N
-   `DensityFrac.md` shows data processing for the density fractionation
    data
